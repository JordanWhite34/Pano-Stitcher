## Introduction

Image stitching is a technique used to combine multiple images with overlapping fields of view to produce a panoramic or high-resolution image. This project leverages Python's OpenCV library to perform seamless image stitching, making it accessible for photographers, developers, and hobbyists to create stunning panoramas effortlessly.

## Features

- **Automatic Image Stitching**: Combines multiple images into a single panoramic image with minimal user intervention.
- **Post-processing Enhancements**: Refines the stitched image by adding borders, thresholding, and contour detection to ensure a clean and polished output.
- **Interactive Image Display**: Displays intermediate and final images, allowing users to visualize each step of the stitching process.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages to guide users in case of issues during image loading or stitching.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have a basic understanding of:

- Python programming
- Image processing concepts
- Installing Python packages

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-stitching-python.git
   cd image-stitching-python

	2.	Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Required Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies:
	•	OpenCV (opencv-python)
	•	imutils
	•	NumPy
	•	glob (Standard Library)

Usage

	1.	Prepare Your Images
	•	Create a directory named Images in the project root.
	•	Place all the .jpeg images you want to stitch inside the Images folder.
	•	Ensure that consecutive images have overlapping regions to facilitate effective stitching.

image-stitching-python/
├── Images/
│   ├── image1.jpeg
│   ├── image2.jpeg
│   └── image3.jpeg
├── image_stitching.py
└── README.md


	2.	Run the Stitching Script

python image_stitching.py

	•	The script will process the images, stitch them together, and display intermediate results.
	•	Press any key to proceed to the next image window.
	•	Press q at any time to exit the script early.

	3.	Output
	•	The final stitched image will be saved as stitchedOutputProcessed.png in the project root directory.
	•	Intermediate outputs such as stitchedOutput.png and processed images will also be saved for reference.

Example

Input Images

Place your input images in the Images folder as shown below.

Stitched Output

After successful stitching, the script generates a stitched panorama.

Processed Output

Post-processing refines the stitched image by cropping and enhancing the panorama.

	Note: Replace path/to/... with the actual paths to your example images.

Troubleshooting

While the image stitching process is generally straightforward, you might encounter some challenges. Here are common issues and their solutions:

	1.	No Images Loaded
	•	Issue: The script prints “No images were loaded. Check your image directory.”
	•	Solution: Ensure that the Images folder exists and contains images with the .jpeg extension. Verify the file paths and image formats.
	2.	Stitching Errors
	•	Issue: The script prints an error status code instead of stitching the images.
	•	Solution:
	•	Verify that all images have sufficient overlapping regions.
	•	Ensure that images are not blurry or have repetitive patterns that confuse feature detectors.
	•	Check OpenCV’s stitcher documentation for detailed information on status codes.
	3.	Poorly Aligned Panoramas
	•	Issue: The stitched image has visible seams or misalignments.
	•	Solution:
	•	Ensure consistent lighting and exposure across all input images.
	•	Use images captured from the same viewpoint with minimal parallax.
	•	Consider resizing large images to reduce processing time and memory usage.
	4.	High Memory Usage with Large Images
	•	Issue: Processing very large images consumes significant memory and slows down the stitching process.
	•	Solution: Uncomment and adjust the resizing line in the script to reduce image dimensions:

img = imutils.resize(img, width=800)
